## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your Neura PDF project up and running locally:

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or higher recommended)
* npm or Yarn
* AWS S3 Bucket
* Google Cloud Project with Gemini API enabled
* Pinecone Account and Index
* A SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd neura-pdf-project
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```


### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. Ensure sensitive keys are NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ if used server-side.

   * #### Clerk Authentication
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
   
   * #### AWS S3 (Note: NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client-side uploads, if any)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_s3_access_key_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_s3_secret_access_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
    AWS_REGION=your_aws_region # e.g., ap-south-1
   
   * #### Google Gemini API
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   
   * #### Pinecone
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
    PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=your_pinecone_environment # or PINECONE_CLOUD/PINECONE_REGION
   
   * #### Database (Drizzle ORM)
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database_name" # Your database connection string


### 4. Database Migrations (if using Drizzle)
Ensure your database schema is in sync. Refer to your Drizzle setup for migration commands (e.g., drizzle-kit push:pg).

5. Run the application
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
## üöÄ Deployment
This project is designed for deployment on Vercel. Ensure all environment variables are correctly configured in your Vercel project settings, paying close attention to the distinction between NEXT_PUBLIC_ and server-only variables.

For handling long-running PDF processing tasks, consider implementing Vercel Background Functions or a Vercel Queue to avoid API timeouts.
